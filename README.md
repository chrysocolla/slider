# Slider
Slider is a small plugin to create an ordered set of tiddlers also called ''Trail''.

A trail can be used to create a sequence of selected contents like step by step tutorial, guided help, lessons and similar.

The slider plugin user interface contains three sections

- A sidebar tab called ''Trails'' to manage trails
- A ''dashboard'' for each trail (where trail structure is managed)
- Tiddlers in a trail, also called ''slides''
